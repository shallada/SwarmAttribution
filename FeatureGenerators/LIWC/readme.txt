How to run LIWC
---------------

LIWC is an interactive program (requiring a license). Start the program by running LIWC2015. From the main screen, select "Analyze Text". Next, select the button for "Text in folder". In the window, select a folder from the Datasets folder. Respond "no" to the question about sub-folders. When LIWC completes the analysis, File->Save Results to a file in the Concatenator folder, with a subfolder for the dataset name. Name the file LIWCFeatures.txt.

Post-process the results to remove the header line and sort the file by running PostProcess.sh.
